TRIE DATA STUCTURE -> EACH NODE IN THE TRIE DATA STRUCTURE IS REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE ARRAY OF 26 NUMBERS , WHERE TRIE [I][ LETTER - 'A' ],(I WAS THE POSITION WHERE THE CURRENT ELEMENT IS PLACE,) REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF THE ARRAY WHERE THE NEXT ELEMENT SHOULD BE PLACED...

IMPLEMENTATION ==>

===========================================================================
const int maxn = 1e6+23;
ll  Trie [ maxn][27];
ll m;
//maintain a global variable m which will help to figure out the next location of the array that can be given to the next character of the string .
//lets take n string as input and maintain a trie of the given strings;

// whenever we encounter such Trie[i][j] such that its zero we claim that no node is present here...

void main()
{
    int n ;cin>>n;
    string s;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>s;int next=0;
        for(auto it:s)
        {
            if(!Trie[next][s-'a'])Trie[next][s-'a']=++m;
            next = Trie[next][s-'a'];
        }
        
    }
}
